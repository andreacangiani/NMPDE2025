SISSA course on Numerical Methods for PDEs

This is a Joint course between SISSA PhD in Mathematical Analysis, Modeling, and Applications, Laurea Magistrale in Matematica, and the Laurea Magistrale in Data Science and Scientific Computing.

Course materials are available on the course github repository.
